AP reports that any custom textured armour sets that were on armour stands DURING the update are now invisible on stands. Armour has been removed and placed back on the stands and the same issue still applies.<br>

Newly gained armour (post update) can be placed on a stand and displays as expected.<br>

Sets Affected in APs Claim: (basing off photo but I would have checked the entire room and upstairs as mentioned in the bug report & listed coords if they didn't have signs etc)
